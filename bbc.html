<h1> Basic UNIX commands  </h1>

Note: not all of these are actually part of UNIX itself, and you may
not find them on all UNIX machines. But they can all be used on <b>turing</b>
in essentially the same way, by typing the command and hitting
return. Note that some of these commands are different on non-Solaris
machines - see <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/sunos-diffs.html">SunOS differences</a>.
<br>
If you've made a typo, the easiest thing to do is hit <b>CTRL-u</b> to
cancel the whole line. But you can also edit the command line (see the
guide to <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/more-unix.html#com">More UNIX</a>). 
<br>
UNIX is case-sensitive.

<h2>Files</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>ls</b> --- lists your files
<br>
<b>ls -l</b> --- lists your files in 'long format', which contains lots of
useful information, e.g. the exact size of the file, who owns the file
and who has the right to look at it, and when it was last modified.
<br> 
<b>ls -a </b> --- lists all files, including the ones whose filenames begin in
a dot, which you do not always want to see.
<br>
There are many more options, for example to list files by size, by
date, recursively etc.
</li><li><b>more <i>filename</i></b> --- shows the first part of a file,
just as much as will fit on one screen. Just hit the space bar to see
more or <b>q</b> to quit. You can use <b>/<i>pattern</i></b> to
search for a pattern.
</li><li><b>emacs <i>filename</i></b> --- is an editor that lets you
     create and edit a file. See the <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/emacs.html">emacs page</a>.
</li><li><b>mv <i>filename1 filename2</i></b> --- moves a file (i.e. gives
it a different name, or moves it into a different directory (see below)
</li><li><b>cp <i>filename1 filename2</i></b> --- copies a file
</li><li><b>rm <i>filename</i></b> --- removes a file. It is wise to use
the option rm -i, which will ask you for confirmation before actually
deleting anything. You can make this your default by making an <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/alias.html">alias</a> in your .cshrc file.
</li><li><b>diff <i>filename1 filename2</i></b> --- compares files, and
shows where they differ
</li><li><b>wc <i>filename</i></b> --- tells you how many lines, words,
and characters there are in a file
</li><li><b>chmod <i>options filename</i></b> --- lets you change the read,
write, and execute permissions on your files. The default is that only
you can look at them and change them, but you may sometimes want to
change these permissions. For example, <b>chmod o+r
<i>filename</i></b> will make the file readable for everyone, and 
<b>chmod o-r <i>filename</i></b> will make it unreadable for others
again. Note that for someone to be able to actually look at the file
the directories it is in need to be at least executable. See <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/Help/.help/intro-computer/protection">help protection</a> for more details.
</li><li>File Compression
<ul>
<li><b>gzip <i>filename</i></b> --- compresses files, so that they
take up much less space. Usually text files compress to about half
their original size, but it depends very much on the size of the file
and the nature of the contents. There are other tools for this
purpose, too (e.g. <b>compress</b>), but gzip usually gives the
highest compression rate. Gzip produces files with the ending '.gz'
appended to the original filename.
</li><li><b>gunzip <i>filename</i></b> --- uncompresses files compressed by gzip.
</li><li><b>gzcat <i>filename</i></b> --- lets you look at a gzipped file without
actually having to gunzip it (same as <b>gunzip -c</b>). You can even
print it directly, using <b>gzcat <i>filename</i> | lpr</b>
</li></ul>
</li><li><a name="pr">printing</a>
<ul>
<li><b>lpr <i>filename</i></b> --- print. Use the -P option to specify
the printer name if you want to use a printer other than your default
printer. For example, if you want to print double-sided, use 'lpr
-Pvalkyr-d', or if you're at CSLI, you may want to use 'lpr
-Pcord115-d'. See 'help printers' for more information about printers
and their locations.
</li><li><b>lpq</b> --- check out the printer queue, e.g. to get the
number needed for removal, or to see how many other files will be  printed
before yours will come out
</li><li><b>lprm <i>jobnumber</i></b> --- remove something from the
printer queue. You can find the job number by using lpq. Theoretically
you also have to specify a printer name, but this isn't necessary as
long as you use your default printer in the department.
</li><li><b>genscript</b> --- converts plain text files into postscript
for printing, and gives you some options for formatting. Consider
making an alias like <b>alias ecop 'genscript -2 -r \!* | lpr -h -Pvalkyr'</b>
to print two pages on one piece of paper.
</li><li><b>dvips <i>filename</i></b> --- print <b>.dvi</b> files (i.e.
files produced by LaTeX). You can use <b>dviselect</b> to print only
selected pages. See the <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/latex.html">LaTeX page</a> for more
information about how to save paper when printing drafts.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>Directories</h2>
Directories, like folders on a Macintosh, are used to group files
together in a hierarchical structure.
<ul>
<li><b>mkdir <i>dirname</i></b> --- make a new directory
</li><li><b>cd <i>dirname</i></b> --- change directory. You basically 'go'
to another directory, and you will see the files in that directory
when you do 'ls'. You always start out in your 'home directory', and
you can get back there by typing 'cd' without arguments. 'cd ..' will
get you one level up from your current position. You don't have to
walk along step by step - you can make big leaps or avoid walking
around by specifying <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/pathnames.html">pathnames</a>.
</li><li><b>pwd</b> --- tells you where you currently are.
</li></ul>

<h2>Finding things</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>ff</b> --- find files anywhere on the system. This can be
extremely useful if you've forgotten in which directory you put a
file, but do remember the name. In fact, if you use <b>ff -p</b> you don't
even need the full name, just the beginning. This can also be useful
for finding other things on the system, e.g. documentation. 
</li><li><b>grep <i>string filename(s)</i></b> --- looks for the string in
the files. This can be useful a lot of purposes, e.g. finding
the right file among many, figuring out which is the right version of
something, and even  doing serious corpus work. grep comes in several
varieties (<b>grep</b>, <b>egrep</b>, and <b>fgrep</b>) and has a lot
of very flexible options. Check out the man pages if this sounds good
to you.
</li></ul>

<h2>About other people</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>w</b> --- tells you who's logged in, and what they're doing.
Especially useful: the 'idle' part. This allows you to see whether
they're actually sitting there typing away at their keyboards right at
the moment.
</li><li><b>who</b> --- tells you who's logged on, and where they're
coming from. Useful if you're looking for someone who's actually
physically in the same building as you, or in some other particular
location.
</li><li><b>finger <i>username</i></b> --- gives you lots of information
about that user, e.g. when they last read their mail and whether they're
logged in. Often people put other practical information, such as phone
numbers and addresses, in a file called <b>.plan</b>. This information is
also displayed by 'finger'.
</li><li><b>last -1 <i>username</i></b> --- tells you when the user last
logged on and off and from where. Without any options, <b>last</b> will
give you a list of everyone's logins.
</li><li><b>talk <i>username</i></b> --- lets you have a (typed) conversation with
another user
</li><li><b>write <i>username</i></b> --- lets you exchange one-line
messages with another user
</li><li><b>elm</b> --- lets you send e-mail messages to people around the
world (and, of course, read them). It's not the only mailer you can
use, but the one we recommend. See the <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/elm.html">elm
page</a>, and find out about the departmental <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/mailing-lists">
mailing lists</a> (which you can also find in
/user/linguistics/helpfile).
</li></ul>

<h2>About your (electronic) self</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>whoami</b> --- returns your username. Sounds useless, but
isn't. You may need to find out who it is who forgot to log
out somewhere, and make sure *you* have logged out.
</li><li><b>finger</b> &amp; .plan files
<br> of course you can finger yourself, too. That can be useful e.g.
as a quick check whether you got new mail. Try to create a useful
.plan file soon. Look at other people's .plan files for ideas. The
file needs to be readable for everyone in order to be visible through
'finger'. Do 'chmod a+r .plan' if necessary. You should realize that
this information is accessible from anywhere in the world, not just to
other people on turing.
</li><li><b>passwd</b> --- lets you change your password, which you should
     do regularly (at least once a year). See the <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/lrb-computing.html#first">LRB guide</a> and/or look at <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/Help/.help/intro-computer/password">help password</a>.
</li><li><b>ps -u <i>yourusername</i></b> --- lists your processes. Contains lots of
information about them, including the process ID, which you need
if you have to kill a process. Normally, when you have been kicked out
of a dialin session or have otherwise managed to get yourself
disconnected abruptly, this list will contain the processes you need
to kill. Those may include the shell (tcsh or whatever you're using),
and anything you were running, for example emacs or elm. Be careful
not to kill your current shell - the one with the number closer to
the one of the ps command you're currently running. But if it happens,
don't panic. Just try again :) If you're using an X-display you may
have to kill some X processes before you can start them again. These
will show only when you use <b>ps -efl</b>, because they're root
processes.
</li><li><b>kill <i>PID</i></b> --- kills (ends) the processes with the ID
you gave. This works only for your own processes, of course. Get the
ID by using <b>ps</b>. If the process doesn't 'die' properly, use
the option -9. But attempt without that option first, because it
doesn't give the process a chance to finish possibly important
business before dying. You may need to kill processes for example if
your modem connection was interrupted and you didn't get logged out
properly, which sometimes happens.
</li><li><b>quota -v</b> --- show what your disk quota
is (i.e. how much space you have to store files), how much you're
actually using, and in case you've exceeded your quota (which you'll
be given an automatic warning about by the system) how much time you
have left to sort them out (by deleting or gzipping some, or moving
them to your own computer).
</li><li><b>du <i>filename</i></b> --- shows the disk usage of the files and
directories in <i>filename</i> (without argument the current directory
is used). <b>du -s</b> gives only a total.
</li><li><b>last <i>yourusername</i></b> --- lists your last logins. Can
be a useful memory aid for when you were where, how long you've been
working for, and keeping track of your phonebill if you're making a
non-local phonecall for dialling in.
</li></ul>

<h2>Connecting to the outside world</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>nn</b> --- allows you to read news. It will first let you read
the news local to turing, and then the remote news. If you want to read
only the local or remote news, you can use <b>nnl</b> or <b>nnr</b>,
respectively. To learn more about <b>nn</b> type <b>nn</b>, then
\tty{:man}, then \tty{=.*}, then \tty{Z}, then hit the space bar to
step through the manual. Or look at the man page. Or check out the
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/usenet/software/nn/getting-started/faq.html">hypertext
nn FAQ</a> - probably the easiest and most fun way to go.
</li><li><b>rlogin <i>hostname</i></b> --- lets you connect to a remote host
</li><li><b>telnet <i>hostname</i></b> --- also lets you connect to a
     remote host. Use <b>rlogin</b> whenever possible.
</li><li><b>ftp <i>hostname</i></b> --- lets you download files from a
remote host which is set up as an ftp-server. This is a common method
for exchanging academic papers and drafts. If you need to make a paper
of yours available in this way, you can (temporarily) put a copy in
/user/ftp/pub/TMP. For more permanent solutions, ask Emma. The most
important commands within ftp are <b>get</b> for getting files from
the remote machine, and <b>put</b> for putting them there (<b>mget</b>
and <b>mput</b> let you specify more than one file at once). Sounds
straightforward, but be sure not to confuse the two, especially when
your physical location doesn't correspond to the direction of the ftp
connection you're making. ftp just overwrites files with the same
filename. If you're transferring anything other than ASCII text, use
binary mode. 
</li><li><b>lynx</b> --- lets you browse the web from an ordinary
terminal. Of course you can see only the text, not the pictures.
You can type any URL as an argument to the <b>G</b> command. When
you're doing this from any Stanford host you can leave out the
<b>.stanford.edu</b> part of the URL when connecting to Stanford URLs.
Type <b>H</b> at any time to learn more about <b>lynx</b>, and
<b>Q</b> to exit.
</li></ul>

<h2>Miscellaneous tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>webster <i>word</i></b> --- looks up the word in an electronic
version of Webster's dictionary and returns the definition(s)
</li><li><b>date</b> --- shows the current date and time.
</li><li><b>cal</b> --- shows a calendar of the current month. Use e.g.,
'cal 10 1995' to get that for October 95, or 'cal 1995' to get the
whole year.
</li></ul>

You can find out more about these commands by looking up their
manpages:
<br>
<b>man <i>commandname</i></b>   --- shows you the manual page for
the command
